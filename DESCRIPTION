Description: Designed to simplify the process of retrieving datasets from the 'BigDataPE' platform using secure token-based authentication. It provides functions for securely storing, retrieving, and managing tokens associated with specific datasets, as well as fetching and processing data using the 'httr2' package. The integration with 'keyring' ensures that tokens are stored securely within the systemâ€™s credential manager.
